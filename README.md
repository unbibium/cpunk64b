Matrix Rain Generator
---------------------

Matrix rain effect generator for C64 and Vic-20.

Building
--------

To build all the things you will need:

* DASM to assemble
* C1541 to build disk images

If you're using a Mac with Homebrew, "brew install dasm vice" should
get you both of these.

`make matrix-64` to make the d64 containing all the variations of the C64 program
`make matrix-vic` to make the vic-20 version, which works on an unexpanded vic.

Notes
-----
This is just a formalization of part of a project I had done for Heatsync Labs
in Mesa AZ.  This is combined with the cyberpunk message generator to provide
some interesting background.  This is why Screen Headliner is also a part of it.
